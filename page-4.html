    <h2>As I have explored my identity through the lens of my mother and the LGBTQ+ community, I have realized that I am not just a copy or product of the people that have passed through my life. I discover and gather the parts I love from everyone, regardless of who they were to me. I take what is said and thought about me along with what I know about me, and create the person I am. I am Sam Woo. I am what you think of me, I am what I think of me.<br><br>
